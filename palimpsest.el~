;;; Documentation:
;;
;; This minor mode provides several strategies to remove text without
;; permanently deleting it, useful to prose / fiction writers.
;; Namely, it provides the following capabilities:
;;

;; Known bugs or limitations:

;; - if several {style}, [lang] or (class) attributes are given for
;;       the same block, only the first one of each type will be
;;       highlighted.
;;
;; - some complex imbrications of inline markup and attributes are
;;       not well-rendered (for example, *strong *{something}notstrong*)
;;
